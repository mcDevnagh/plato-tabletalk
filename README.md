# plato-tabletalk
A fetcher hook for the [Plato](https://github.com/baskerville/plato) document
reader that downloads [TABLETALK Magazines](https://tabletalkmagazine.com/)

## Usage

1. Build a `plato-tabletalk` binary and create a folder in Plato's bin directory for it (usually `/mnt/onboard/.adds/plato/bin/feed`)
2. Edit `Settings.toml` and place it alongside the binary
3. Add a hook to Plato's own `Settings.toml` that looks like the following:
```toml
[[libraries.hooks]]
path = "TABLETALK"
program = "bin/tabletalk/plato-tabletalk"
sort-method = "added"
first-column = "title-and-author"
second-column = "progress"
```
4. Whenever the `TABLETALK` folder is opened, this hook will check if there are
any magazines (within a limit) that haven't been downloaded and will fetch them
if need be.

## Building
The easiest way to build this project is to use
[cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross)
to cross-compile with Docker. Once setup it's as simple as running:
```shell
cross build --release --target=arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf
```

### Building without Docker
After setting up the [Linaro toolchain](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/4.9-2017.01/arm-linux-gnueabihf/)
on your system you can compile the project with:
```shell
rustup target add arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf
cargo build --release --target=arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf
```
